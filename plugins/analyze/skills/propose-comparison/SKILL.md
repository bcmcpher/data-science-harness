description: >
  Start a new analysis as a lightweight "comparison" on its own DataLad branch and record it in
  the project log. Trigger on "propose a comparison", "add an analysis", "new comparison",
  "let's look at X vs Y", "start an analysis branch". Each comparison is one addable unit that can
  be introduced at any point — the story is built from comparisons, not a rigid pipeline.

# Skill: propose-comparison

Create a comparison: a small, branch-scoped analysis unit. In v1 every comparison is an
exploratory quick query realized as a **named DataLad branch** plus a project-log entry. (The
confirmatory / pre-registered end of the rigor spectrum — freezing the spec first via `govern` —
is deferred; the *record* here is already the spec-centric research object of STAMPED §3.12.1.)

## When to use
- The user wants to run any analysis/plot/comparison against the dataset.
- Do NOT use to initialize a project (`project/new-project`) or to execute an already-proposed
  comparison (`analyze/run-comparison`).

## Steps
1. **Capture the comparison** — get from the user (short, one-liner each):
   - `what` — the comparison in a sentence ("group difference in outcome Y")
   - `why` — the question it answers *(optional but encouraged)*
   - expected `inputs` and `outputs` (best guess; refined at run time)
   - rigor: `exploratory` (default in v1). If the user wants `confirmatory`, note that
     pre-registration (`govern/preregister`) is deferred and record it as exploratory-with-intent.
2. **Choose a clear branch name** — `cmp/<short-slug>` (e.g. `cmp/group-diff-y`). The user owns
   naming conventions; suggest one and confirm. Clear, stable names are how comparisons stay
   navigable (the harness does not track branches for you beyond the log).
3. **Create the branch** — delegate to the **datalad doer**:
   > "Create and switch to git branch `cmp/<slug>` in this dataset (leave the working tree clean)."
4. **Log it** — append one entry to `project.yaml`:
   `{ ts, op: propose-comparison, stage: analyze, note: "cmp: <what> (<rigor>)", branch: cmp/<slug> }`.
5. **Report** — the branch name and that the next step is writing the analysis script, then
   `analyze/run-comparison` to execute it with provenance.

## Constraints
- One comparison = one branch. Do not stack unrelated comparisons on the same branch.
- Keep `project.yaml` append-only.
- Do NOT choose the analysis, model, or figures for the user — the harness scaffolds the edges of
  the work (branch, provenance, log), not the scientific question itself. Writing the analysis
  script is the user's job; `run-comparison` wraps whatever they wrote.
- Delegate the branch operation to the datalad doer; never call git/datalad directly.
